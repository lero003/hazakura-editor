# Current Status

Status: Operational
Scope: Current implementation state and next safe actions
Authority: High
Last reviewed: 2026-06-19 (e-book Mode v0.23 planning sync)

## Current State

- `Hazakura Editor` is a Tauri desktop app for Markdown-first safe text editing.
- Current package/app version: `0.20.0` across npm, Tauri, Cargo, and lockfile metadata.
- Mac App Store listing: `Hazakura Editor`
  (`https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/hazakura-editor/id6778637880?mt=12`).
- Latest published GitHub Developer / local-app release: `v0.20.0`.
- Latest published downloadable preview: `v0.20.0` warning-expected DMG preview.
- `v0.18.0` is a Developer / GitHub lane preview, ad-hoc signed, not Developer ID signed, not notarized, and expected to show macOS security warnings.
- The helper-free App Store lane delivered `0.18.0` build `4` to
  TestFlight on 2026-06-12 with no reported Apple validation warnings;
  basic TestFlight launch / save smoke passed.
- The `0.19.0` App Store lane passed App Review and was published on
  2026-06-18, based on the user-provided public listing above. The
  tracked submit-lane candidate for that approval was build counter
  `14`; local package and signing evidence remain historical release
  evidence, not the next active queue.
- The next helper-free App Store update package candidate is `0.20.0`
  build `15`. Local packaging/signing checks passed on 2026-06-18, and
  the generated package is
  `src-tauri/target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/pkg/HazakuraEditor-0.20.0-build15-mas.pkg`.
  Upload, Apple validation, TestFlight distribution, manual TestFlight
  smoke, and App Review are not claimed yet.
- Pre-approval human-side App Store lane smoke on 2026-06-12 passed launch,
  basic document creation/open, preview/export, image paste/drag-drop,
  App Store surface omission, dirty-close confirmation, Move to Trash,
  and network observation. Save As UX remains an observation, workspace
  restore is acceptable with a residual Google Drive /
  quit-before-interaction risk, and live accessibility was partial at
  that checkpoint. A `Cmd+Shift+F` global-search result activation bug
  found during smoke has a focused code-level fix.
- Older public tags and release assets remain immutable.
- Current active work is post-approval documentation closeout and the
  next product slice. Local pre-review regression, package, payload,
  dependency-audit, bundle metadata, license-resource, and bundle-size
  evidence remains archived under `docs/archive/operations/` or
  summarized in `docs/current-work.md`; it should no longer drive the
  main queue unless a new App Store build is prepared.
- The v0.20 Sakura workspace ergonomics slice is implemented locally:
  the main chrome can collapse / restore the workspace sidebar, the
  central editor pane keeps a thin bottom full-path copy bar for the
  active file, Markdown preview hierarchy is more card-like, and the
  selected workspace file has Sakura-specific accenting. The tab-row
  new-file `+` affordance was removed after visual review; New File
  remains available through existing menu, shortcut, and workspace-file
  actions. Workspace switching dropdowns remain deferred to preserve the
  simple single-workspace model.

## Current Product Boundary

- Safe Editor remains the primary product surface.
- Markdown/text source remains the saved document model.
- Default Safe Editor Mode has no Git client, LSP, general terminal,
  arbitrary command execution, plugin system, project-wide indexing,
  auto-apply, or auto-commit behavior.
- Agent Workbench is optional and explicit. It may host one allowlisted
  `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, or `claude` provider session in the
  selected workspace after restart-required enablement and
  responsibility-boundary consent.
- Manual Review Desk entry points are hidden for the current App
  Store-oriented surface. Diff, recovery review, and Apple Local Assist
  edit review remain explicit, unsaved, and inspectable.
- Workspace file operations are bounded to the selected workspace.
  Workspace-internal drag/drop Move remains experimental; New File, New
  Folder, Rename, and Move to Trash are the dependable file-tree
  operations.

## Implemented Surface Summary

- Safe open/edit/save for Markdown and text files, including LF / CRLF,
  final-newline, UTF-8 BOM, Shift-JIS, and EUC-JP handling.
- The sandbox-oriented direct save fallback preserves the normal atomic
  save path, and when direct write / sync fails after a partial write it
  attempts to restore the original bytes before reporting failure.
- Read-only preview for user-selected local PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP image files
  up to 20 MB, including directly opened files outside the selected
  workspace.
- Clipboard image paste now rejects decoded PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP payloads
  above the same 20 MB image boundary before allocating the decoded
  buffer; drag/drop image import keeps the existing 20 MB file-size cap.
- Multi-tab editor with dirty-tab close protection, app/window close
  confirmation, save-conflict recovery, and explicit draft recovery.
- Normal Safe Editor chrome now exposes a main-chrome workspace sidebar
  toggle routed through the existing sidebar collapse flow. New File
  remains available through the native menu, keyboard shortcut, command
  palette, and bounded workspace-file actions rather than a tab-row `+`
  button.
- Auto-backup snapshots for a workspace file remain distinct even when
  multiple backups are captured in the same second; filenames include
  millisecond precision with a bounded collision suffix, and recovery
  listing stays newest-first.
- Normal Safe Editor mode can collapse and restore the left workspace
  sidebar without changing the file-tree model or L Mode drawer.
- The normal-mode status bar avoids duplicating the active `UTF-8` /
  `LF`-style format values in the passive detail when the trailing
  encoding and line-ending dropdowns already expose them.
- The misleading file-level Recent Files surface is removed from the
  start panel and native File menu. Legacy file-recent localStorage is
  cleared, while Recent Folders and explicit Open / Open Folder remain.
- The macOS About panel inherits canonical Tauri bundle metadata:
  publisher `Hazakura Lab` and
  `Copyright (c) 2026 Hazakura Lab. All rights reserved.`.
- Sanitized Markdown preview, local workspace image handling,
  standalone HTML export, and Print to PDF handoff.
- Markdown preview and Help document links keep supported
  workspace-relative text files inside the app, but route explicit
  `http:` / `https:` / `mailto:` / `tel:` clicks to the OS default
  browser/app without navigating the main WebView.
- L Mode / えるモード as a source-preserving CodeMirror presentation
  layer, not a separate saved document model.
- Diff / explicit change review for active editor changes, recovery
  drafts, external-change conflicts, and Apple Local Assist edits.
- Optional Apple Local Assist alpha in the Developer / GitHub lane as an
  availability-gated, on-device assist surface with explicit unsaved AI
  edit transactions. The published App Store lane omits this helper,
  forces Assist Surface off, and hides command-palette assist / agent
  settings entries.
- Optional Developer / GitHub lane Agent Workbench, separated from the
  App Store lane.
- Help-readable Store-document drafts and Support Diagnostics UI.

- `docs/product-brief.md`: durable product direction and non-goals.
- `docs/security-boundary.md`: safe editor constraints.
- `docs/agent-workbench-boundary.md`: implemented Agent Workbench trust boundary.

## Next Safe Actions

1. For post-approval cleanup, keep App Store-specific evidence public-safe
   and archive only completed version-specific material; canonical build
   and boundary docs stay live for future submissions.
2. For UX work, start with `docs/current-work.md` and pick one item:
   one core Safe Editor quality probe, light accessibility sanity
   adjacent to that surface, or the next e-book Mode reading-surface
   evaluation / follow-up slice.
3. For a future App Store submission, start with `docs/app-store-build.md`;
   keep account-specific notes under ignored `docs/internal/` files and
   treat certificate, provisioning, signing, notarization, upload,
   TestFlight smoke, and review handling as explicit distribution-lane
   work.
4. For Apple Local Assist, use `docs/assist-surface-strategy.md`,
   `docs/apple-local-assist-distribution-plan.md`, and
   `docs/apple-local-assist-writing-companion-plan.md`; keep direct
   buffer edits as explicit AI edit transactions.
5. For future release checkpoints, use the version-specific release
   note plus the release checklists. Do not tag or publish without
   explicit approval.
